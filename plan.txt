Three elements needed for Conway's Game of Life
1. The cells
2. The grid
3. The timing (tick)

-------

1. The cells

Must follow the 4 rules
- Any live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbours survives until the next tick

    if live_cell_neighbours > 1 || live_cell_neighbours < 4
      cell_state = Live
    else
      cell_state = Dead
    end

- Any live cell with less than 2 live neighbours dies (underpopulation)
  
    if live_cell_neighbours < 2
      cell_state = Dead
    end

- Any live cell with more than 3 live neighbours dies (overpopulation)

    if live_cell_neighbours > 3
      cell_state = Dead
    end

- Any dead cell with exactly 3 neighbours becomes a live cell (reproduction)
  
    if live_cell_neighbours = 3
      cell_state = Live
    end

-------

The cell doesn't need to know its specific location, but it needs to know the location of cells around it

Step 1
  Generate a game board
Step 2
  Generate a cell
Step 3
  Generate several cells
Step 4
  Get cells to know which cells are around them
Step 5
  Get cells to act based on the cells around them
Step 6
  Start several cycles

Questions
- How do you define something and it's location in code form?
- How do you test something like this?

Tests
- Does the game board exist
- Does a cell exist
- Does a cell have a location
- Does a cell know its state
- Do multiple cells exist
- Do multiple cells have locations
- Does a cell know how many other cells are around it
- Does a cell know what to do based on the cells around it
