Three elements needed for Conway's Game of Life
1. The cells
2. The grid
3. The timing (tick)

1. The cells

Must follow the 4 rules
- Any live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbours survives until the next tick
- Any live cell with less than 2 live neighbours dies (underpopulation)
- Any live cell with more than 3 live neighbours dies (overpopulation)
- Any dead cell with exactly 3 neighbours becomes a live cell (reproduction)

The cell doesn't need to know its specific location, but it needs to know the location of cells around it

Step 1
  Start Game
Step 2
  Generate a cell
Step 3
  Generate several cells
Step 4
  Get cells to know which cells are around them
Step 5
  Get cells to act based on the cells around them
Step 6
  Start several cycles

Questions
- How do you define something and it's location in code form?
